# OL305 Smart Lock ESP

This project implements an intelligent bike-locker(ol305 ble locker) lock/unlock system using an ESP platform (ESP8266/ESP32). 

## Features

- **Remote Control:** Lock and unlock the bike-locker remote.
- **Secure Authentication:** Integration with authentication methods (e.g., fingerprint, RFID cards, or other technologies – depending on the project implementation).
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Instant feedback on the door status (locked/unlocked).
- **Easy to Integrate:** The project can be customized and integrated into various smart home systems.

## Overview

The OL305 Smart Lock ESP project uses an ESP module to control an electronic locking mechanism, allowing for:
- Wi-Fi connectivity for remote access.
- Configuration and customization through an integrated web interface.
- Expandability for integration with other automation or security systems.

## Required Hardware

- **ESP8266/ESP32 Module:** The heart of the system for connectivity and processing.
- **Sensors (optional):** Position or contact sensors for monitoring the door's state.
- **Other Components:** Resistors, transistors, power supply, etc., according to the electrical schematic.

> **Note:** For detailed information on the hardware schematic and component list, refer to the technical documentation included in the project or related documents.

## Usage

1. **Powering the Device:** After uploading the code, power the ESP board. The module will connect to the BLE(bluetooth low energy) according to the specified settings.
2. **Controlling the bike locker:** All the cmds for the locker are implemented and you have acces to them.
3. **Expansion:** If necessary, integrate the system with other applications or smart home systems for centralized control.
